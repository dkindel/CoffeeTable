This is a working repo for the Coffee Table project.  It is an arduino project to build Tetris, Snake, a color changer, and music visualizer on a coffee table.  

The submodule added is all the libraries in my Arduino lib folder.  Included in these libs are the implementations for Tetris and Snake.
